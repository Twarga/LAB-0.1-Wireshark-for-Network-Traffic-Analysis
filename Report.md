### **1. Introduction**
The objective of this lab was to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark, focusing on different protocols such as HTTP, DNS, and ICMP. This report summarizes the findings from the captured traffic and provides insights into the behavior of these protocols.

### **2. Protocols Observed**
During the analysis, the following protocols were identified:

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

### **3. Findings**

#### **3.1 HTTP Traffic Analysis**
- **Overview**: HTTP traffic was generated by visiting multiple websites during the capture session.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Analyzed **GET** requests for resources such as HTML pages, images, and CSS files.
  - Notable packets included:
    - Source IP: `192.168.1.12` (Client) → Destination IP: 1`46.199.62.39 `([httpforever.com](http://httpforever.com/))
    - Request Method: `GET`
    - Response Status Code: `200 OK`
  - The typical size of HTTP responses ranged from 1 KB to 150 KB, depending on the content type (e.g., images vs. text).

#### **3.2 DNS Traffic Analysis**
- **Overview**: DNS queries were captured when accessing websites, translating domain names to IP addresses.
- **Key Observations**:
  - DNS queries observed:
    - Source IP: `192.168.1.12` → Destination IP: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
    - Query Type: `A` (Address Record)
    - Query for: `www.httpforever.com`
  - Response packets included the corresponding IP address, confirming successful name resolution.

#### **3.3 ICMP Traffic Analysis**
- **Overview**: ICMP traffic was generated by pinging remote hosts.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Captured ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply packets.
  - Example packet details:
    - Source IP: `192.168.1.12` → Destination IP: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
    - Type: `Echo Request` (Type 8)
    - Response: `Echo Reply` (Type 0) with round-trip time measured.

#### **3.4 TCP Analysis**
- **Overview**: Analyzed the TCP handshake during HTTP connections.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Captured the three-way handshake:
    - SYN: Client initiates the connection.
    - SYN-ACK: Server acknowledges the connection request.
    - ACK: Client confirms the connection establishment.
  - Example packet sequence:
    - Client to Server (SYN): `192.168.1.12` → `93.184.216.34`
    - Server to Client (SYN-ACK): `93.184.216.34` → `192.168.1.12`
    - Client to Server (ACK): `192.168.1.12` → `93.184.216.34`

### **4. Conclusion**
This lab successfully demonstrated the ability to capture and analyze various types of network traffic using Wireshark. By examining HTTP, DNS, ICMP, and TCP protocols, valuable insights into network behavior and communication patterns were gained. This experience enhances our understanding of network operations, which is crucial for troubleshooting and network management.
